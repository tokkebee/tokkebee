Hello! I’m Oliver Kim (he/him)
I'm interested in the Game Design industry in all aspects:
  - Coding
  - Design
  - Art

But I'm currently interested in being a Technical Artist,
  someone who creates tools to automate some parts of the artistic process.

So far, I know all sorts of art and basic code,
  but I'm currently learning C# and Maya.

Check out my LinkedIn, ArtStationm and itch.io through my Linktree!
